# Data Science IOT Anomaly, Risk, and Failure Prediction Detection: Project Overview
* Any dataset can be implemented from similar IoT related devices that produce time series data.
* This project can help you to learn:
**- how to approach sensors data
**- how to find anomalies which can identify pumps or other IOT devices at risk,
**- slopes in the time series record, another indicator of potential failure. 
**- python code which can be run on AWS Sagemaker or a desktop Jupyter notebook 

## Code and Resources Used
* Python Version: 3.7
* Packages/Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, pyplot, seaborn, sklearn, LabelEncoder, train_test_split, LogisticRegression, confusion_matrix, classification_report, accuracy_score 
* Dataframe Shape
